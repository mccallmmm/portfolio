These projects are intended to show some cool DS abilities and grow my skillset on techniques I don't encounter at work! Right now I've only gotten a basic ML exploration done on some OKCupid data, which can be found in the `okcupid_data` directory. I'll be adding some projects soon, but they aren't quite finished yet! 

This group of projects uses poetry to install the required dependencies. To install poetry, you can [follow the instructions on their website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/). In order to install and run 

1. Make sure the `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml` are untouched from the remote.
2. Run `poetry install` with the correct lock file.
3. To spawn a shell, run `poetry shell`.

I've chosen a basic regression/attribution example on some interesting data as a first example. [You can work through it here](/okcupid_data/xgboost_example.ipynb).
